# Simple IRC Chat - Design Document

## Project Overview

A minimal IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client application written in Python. This project aims to create a simple, terminal-based chat client that can connect to IRC servers, join channels, and send/receive messages in real-time.

**Goals:**
- Learn IRC protocol fundamentals
- Build a working chat client with minimal complexity
- Create a foundation for future enhancements
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features

**Target Users:**
- Developers wanting to understand IRC protocol
- Users needing a simple, lightweight IRC client
- Educational purposes for network programming

**Scope:**
- Single server connection
- Single channel participation
- Basic message sending/receiving
- Simple terminal interface
- Essential IRC commands only

## Core Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Connect to an IRC server using TCP socket connection
- Authenticate with nickname and user information
- Join a specified IRC channel
- Send text messages to the channel
- Receive and display messages from other users in real-time
- Handle basic IRC commands (/quit, /join, /nick)
- Gracefully disconnect from server

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Simple terminal-based user interface
- Responsive message handling (no significant delays)
- Stable connection handling with basic error recovery
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Minimal resource usage
- Clear, readable code structure

**Technical Constraints:**
- Python 3.7+ (using built-in libraries where possible)
- No external dependencies for core functionality
- Single-threaded or simple multi-threading approach
- Plain text communication (no encryption initially)
- Standard IRC protocol compliance (RFC 1459/2812 basics)

**Out of Scope (for initial version):**
- Multiple server connections
- Multiple channel management
- User authentication beyond basic nickname
- Message logging/history
- File transfers
- Advanced IRC features (modes, operator commands)
- Graphical user interface
