## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Threading Issues**: Start with simple threading, test extensively
2. **IRC Protocol Compliance**: Test with multiple servers early
3. **Network Reliability**: Implement basic error handling from day 1
4. **Cross-Platform Issues**: Test on target platforms weekly

### Contingency Plans
- **Threading Problems**: Fall back to select-based single-thread approach
- **Protocol Issues**: Focus on major IRC servers (Libera, Freenode)
- **Performance Issues**: Limit scope to small channels initially
- **Time Constraints**: Cut optional features (/me, fancy formatting)

## Development Guidelines

### Daily Practices
- Commit working code daily
- Test on real IRC server before committing
- Keep backup of working versions
- Document issues and solutions
