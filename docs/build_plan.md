## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Threading Issues**: Start with simple threading, test extensively
2. **IRC Protocol Compliance**: Test with multiple servers early
3. **Network Reliability**: Implement basic error handling from day 1
4. **Cross-Platform Issues**: Test on target platforms weekly

### Contingency Plans
- **Threading Problems**: Fall back to select-based single-thread approach
- **Protocol Issues**: Focus on major IRC servers (Libera, Freenode)
- **Performance Issues**: Limit scope to small channels initially
- **Time Constraints**: Cut optional features (/me, fancy formatting)

## Development Guidelines

### Daily Practices
- Commit working code daily
- Test on real IRC server before committing
- Keep backup of working versions
- Document issues and solutions

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: Basic connection and authentication
- **Week 2**: Channel joining and message display
- **Week 3**: Interactive commands and user input
- **Week 4**: Command completion and error handling
- **Week 5**: Stability and polish
- **Week 6**: Testing and documentation

### Quality Gates
Each stage must pass before proceeding:
- Code works on target IRC server
- No crashes on normal operations
- Basic error handling implemented
- Core functionality demonstrates success criteria

## Tools & Environment Setup

### Development Stack
- **Python 3.7+** (latest stable recommended)
- **Git** for version control
- **VS Code** or preferred editor
- **Terminal** for testing

### Testing Environment
- **Primary IRC Server**: irc.libera.chat
- **Test Channel**: #bottest or similar low-traffic channel
- **Platforms**: macOS (primary), Windows, Linux

### Optional Tools (Later Stages)
- `pytest` for automated testing
- `black` for code formatting
- `flake8` for linting
- Virtual environment for dependency management

## Success Metrics

### Stage Completion Criteria
- **Stage 1**: Can connect to IRC server
- **Stage 2**: Can authenticate and handle PING/PONG
- **Stage 3**: Can join channel and see/send messages
- **Stage 4**: All basic commands functional
- **Stage 5**: Stable for 30+ minutes in active channel
- **Stage 6**: Ready for public GitHub release

### Final Success Metrics
- Works on 3+ major IRC servers
- Handles 100+ message channel without issues
- Runs stable for hours without intervention
- Clear documentation for new users
