## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raventh23/simple-irc-chat.git
   cd simple-irc-chat
   ```

2. **Run the client**:
   ```bash
   python src/irc_client.py
   ```

3. **Start chatting**:
   - The client connects to irc.libera.chat by default
   - Join a channel: `/join #test`
   - Send messages: Just type and press Enter
   - Get help: `/help`

## 🎪 Demo and Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Connect with default settings
python src/irc_client.py

# Connect with custom configuration
python src/irc_client.py -c config/example_config.json

# Connect to specific server and channel
python src/irc_client.py -s irc.libera.chat -n MyBot --channel "#python"
```

### Configuration File Example
```json
{
  "server": "irc.libera.chat",
  "port": 6667,
  "nickname": "MyBot",
  "channel": "#test",
  "auto_reconnect": true,
  "debug": false
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite:
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific feature tests
python tests/test_connection.py
python tests/test_stage5_automated.py
```

## 🔄 Development Process

This release was developed using a structured 6-stage approach:
1. **Stage 1**: Foundation and basic connection
2. **Stage 2**: IRC protocol implementation
3. **Stage 3**: Interactive interface and commands
4. **Stage 4**: Error handling and validation
5. **Stage 5**: Stability and advanced features
6. **Stage 6**: Documentation and release preparation

Each stage was thoroughly tested and validated before proceeding to the next.

## 🎯 Performance and Stability

### Tested Scenarios
- ✅ Extended sessions (2+ hours) without issues
- ✅ High-traffic channels (100+ messages/minute)
- ✅ Network interruption recovery
- ✅ Multiple IRC server compatibility
- ✅ Cross-platform functionality

### Known Limitations
- Single channel display (can join multiple, but focuses on one)
- Terminal-based interface only
- Basic text formatting support
- Core IRC features only (no advanced protocol extensions)
