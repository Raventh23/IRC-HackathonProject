## IRC Basics

### What is IRC?

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a text-based chat protocol that has been around since 1988. It allows real-time communication in channels (rooms) or private messages.

### Key Concepts

#### Servers and Networks
- **Server**: A computer running IRC server software
- **Network**: A group of connected servers (like Libera.Chat)
- **Client**: Software you use to connect to IRC (like this client)

#### Channels
- **Channel**: A chat room where multiple people can talk
- **Channel names**: Start with # (like #python, #help)
- **Topic**: A description of what the channel is about
- **Modes**: Settings that control channel behavior

#### Users and Nicknames
- **Nickname**: Your identity on IRC (like a username)
- **Real name**: Optional full name (usually not displayed)
- **Username**: Technical identifier (usually not important for users)

#### Common IRC Terms

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Nick** | Your nickname/identity |
| **Channel** | Chat room (starts with #) |
| **Op** | Channel operator (has special privileges) |
| **Kick** | Forcibly remove someone from channel |
| **Ban** | Prevent someone from joining channel |
| **Mode** | Channel or user setting |
| **PING/PONG** | Keepalive messages to maintain connection |
| **Quit** | Leave IRC entirely |
| **Part** | Leave a specific channel |

### IRC Etiquette

#### General Guidelines
1. **Be respectful** - Treat others as you'd like to be treated
2. **Stay on topic** - Keep discussions relevant to the channel
3. **Don't spam** - Avoid repeating messages or flooding
4. **Use proper channels** - Ask questions in appropriate places
5. **Be patient** - People may not respond immediately

#### Channel-Specific Rules
- Read channel topic and rules when joining
- Some channels have specific purposes (help, development, social)
- Respect channel operators and their decisions
- Use `/help` channels for getting assistance

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't ask to ask - just ask your question
- Don't send the same message to multiple channels
- Don't use ALL CAPS (considered shouting)
- Don't share personal information publicly
- Don't argue with channel operators

### Popular IRC Networks

| Network | Address | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Libera.Chat** | irc.libera.chat | Open source and free software communities |
| **OFTC** | irc.oftc.net | Open and Free Technology Community |
| **Rizon** | irc.rizon.net | General purpose network |
| **EFNet** | irc.efnet.org | One of the oldest IRC networks |

### Getting Started on IRC

1. **Choose a nickname** - Pick something unique and appropriate
2. **Start with beginner channels** - Try #help or #new2irc
3. **Learn the basics** - Practice basic commands
4. **Find communities** - Look for channels matching your interests
5. **Be patient** - IRC culture can take time to understand

### Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:
- Explore different channels and communities
- Learn advanced IRC commands and features

- Join project-specific channels for software you use
- Participate in IRC communities related to your interests
